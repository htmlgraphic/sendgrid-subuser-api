PHP SendGrid Subuser API
========================

This repo has been motified to work better with Composer for package management.

This PHP library makes it easy to work with the `SendGrid Subuser API`_.
It was made to scratch our own itch, and as such it currently only
implements the parts of the API that we needed. Please feel free to
request additional features or send pull requests.
